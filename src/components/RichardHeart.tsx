          Richard Heart is one of the innovators working to expand the worldwide reach of cryptocurrency. He is the face of HEX, PulseChain and PulseX. Richard's approach started off with the launching of the project, HEX. Project HEX is a novel method that cuts out the middleman and puts more money in the buyer's pocket. He then introduced PulseChain and PulseX.

          Richard Heart was brought up in an inner-city school system. He recalls being one of the few white students at a predominantly black gifted school. The school placed a strong emphasis on teaching a curriculum that was centered on students' reasoning and scheme programming abilities. Heart says, "I got lucky with my education; I went to college early."

          Early in his life, he was exposed to entrepreneurship and invention. Heart, inspired by his friend (a computer business owner in his basement), started an at-home car stereo business. They later built a shopping cart platform together, sold by Heart. Richard, on the other hand, got his first job delivering newspapers for his father, who also ran an air conditioning company. He recalls the arduous conditions of his initial occupations, as well as the strong work ethic he learnt from.

          Afterwards, Richard Heart networked with his colleagues by exchanging business ideas. He then started a mortgage company conducting pay per click management (PPC) and working on search engine optimization (SEO). His income was $60 million per year and was able to retire and travel the world. Heart explains how he came across Bitcoin for $1, thanks to Reddit. He soon realized flaws within Bitcoin, ultimately leading him to create Hex and then PulseChain and then PulseX.

          In Richard Heart's book <i>SciVive</i>, he will give nine secrets that you need to win at life. His overall aim is to make it simple for people to understand various aspects of life. Although he believes that money is important, it's not the only thing we should all be working for.

          The SENS Foundation is dedicated to the pursuit of anti-aging research. In particular, the foundation aims to repair cellular damage caused over time, and even to reverse it. The SENS Foundation was established in 2009, the same year Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin white paper.
