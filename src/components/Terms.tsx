              A PulseChainArt NFT is a non-fungible Ethereum-based token that uses smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain (“Smart Contracts”). The Ethereum blockchain provides an immutable ledger of all transactions that occur on the blockchain. This means that all PulseChainArt NFTs are outside of the control of any one party, including OVIYUM, and are subject to many risks and uncertainties. OVIYUM neither owns nor controls MetaMask, WalletConnect, the Ethereum network, your browser, or any other third party site, product, or service (including third party wallets or marketplaces) that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the Services or to purchase, list, auction, or sell PulseChainArt NFTs (“Transaction”), and that, except with respect to transferring control of a PulseChainArt NFT to the initial purchaser through the Services (“Initial Purchaser”), OVIYUM has no responsibility with respect to any Transaction. OVIYUM will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any third parties, nor will OVIYUM be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any third parties. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a Transaction. Aside from transferring control of the PulseChainArt NFT to the Initial Purchaser, OVIYUM has no control over the transfer, storage, ownership or maintenance of the PulseChainArt NFT.
